                <p>Hello, I'm Tomasz. When I got Frotka, my first dog, I was super excited about raising her to be a great companion. I was ready for the work, for constantly wondering what I could do better for her. When I take on a challenge like that, new area to discover, I get obsessive.</p>
                <p>And I went deep down the rabbit hole. All the videos, paid online courses, whole spectrum of techniques and approaches.</p>
                <p>But then I was home with her, dealing with a real, living creature I took under my care, and it got me nowhere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-block">
                <p>I had this picture of what we could be together. A real partnership, a dog I could do everything with. Meanwhile, all I could feel was the critical stages of her development passing by while I fumbled with techniques that felt increasingly hollow.</p>
                <p>It wasn't that she was badly behaved. She wasn't lunging at people or destroying things. We just couldn't work together. She didn't want to play, she didn't want treats that much, at home she was restless and outside she was a deranged sniff-junkie with absolute zero contact. I couldn't reach her.</p>
                <p>I couldn't find good guidance anywhere and I literally cried in desperation.</p>

                <p>Puppy classes program didn't include much more than luring into a sit and when someone asked about biting clothes, all we got was a 10 minute non-answer.</p>
                <p>Then I paid for a behavioral consultation… and was simply appalled.</p>
                <p>We also went to a dog sport introductory camp looking for a pleasant vacation around dog people. But what I saw was again, appaling.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Dogs not allowed to see each other and forced to wait in cars or empty rooms.</li>
                  <li>Everyone dealing with behavioral problems instead of having fun with a frisbee.</li>
                  <li>Dogs visibly trying to run for their lives while being pulled on a leash over a bar.</li>
                  <li>And owners literally crying under the trainer's guideance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And then there's Facebook – #evilflexi! #podbiegacz! #agresor! – what the actual fuck?</p>
                <p>Wherever I looked, no real answers. Just this growing sense that something is deeply off with the dog world I was witnessing. </p>

              <h3>Maybe you've noticed this too</h3>
              <p>The people with the biggest followings aren't always the ones with the deepest knowledge. The trainers with views are often very good at social media, which isn't the same as being exceptional at dogs.</p>
              <p>At the same time, people recommend trainers on Facebook because they like them as a person, because it's a nice atmosphere on the shared walks. Circles of mutual adoration are built, while the impact on the dogs takes the second place.</p>
              <p>Let's face it, most people have little idea of what they're doing. That's true in every field, every industry. Most people know enough to sound like they know what they're talking about. Far fewer actually do.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-block">
              <p>Why is that dog training seems to be the only industry where so called professionals can say "I rehabilitated thousands of dogs" and have nothing to show for it?</p>
              <p>Why is it ok for trainers to proclaim what's evil and what is the ultimate path to happiness and give zero actual proof? Why in so crucial matter the bar is so embarassingly low?</p>
              <p>Usually the stakes are low but here we're talking dogs. At best, the wrong information makes a pet dog a little bit annoying to live with. At worst, it gets them routinely killed at shelters.</p>
              <p>So when the common popular knowledge doesn't sit right with you, if you followed or even paid for advice and you still don't understand how it's supposed to bring you closer to sharing adventures with your dog, I get it. I've been there, I got mad, and it's ok to be mad.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-divider">• • •</div>

            <div class="story-block">
              <p>Then I found the right people, that share and promote the vision of how I would like to live with my dogs.</p>
              <p>How to enable them to explore courageously, play hard, have meaningful relationships, overcome challenges but also feel content and safe. All that while actually being safe, and not being a nuisance to anybody.</p>
              <p class="story-highlight">It's about understanding the living creature you've committed to, what they need to feel secure, how to give them structure without crushing their spirit and how to let them be a dog while also existing peacefully in your world.</p>
              <p>Dogs are highly intelligent, social, and emotionally aware, they've been pretty much designed that way and they deserve appropriate respect. Moreover, they are highly resilient and some of those already condemned to die are being rehabilitated every day.</p>
              <p>It's on us to make them feel like somebody and you can't do that by confinement, whether it's on a leash or via obedience, and shoving food into their faces while they want nothing to do with you or given situation.</p>
              <p>Whether it's teaching a naive puppy how to live or helping an adult dog overcome years of trauma, we need to prepare them and lead, not away, but through the challenges they need to face.</p>
              <p>It's not some undiscoverable dark art. It's just an unwavering empathy, solid mindset and couple of principles informing thousand small decisions.

              <h3>Who am I in all of that?</h3>
              <p>Definitely not a professional trainer. No certifications, no credentials.</p>
              <p>I've got my dog and dogs of my friends I work with whenever they'll let me. Me and my partner also dog-sit for strangers, and I jump at every other similar opportunity because every dog teaches me something different.</p>
              <p>I follow people that are far beyond struggling for business, yet spend the time to present the real work it takes to train and rehabilitate dogs. Those who are highly decorated in dog sports, and also, through their work, move dogs away from euthanasia into happy families. They show what it takes and don't sanitize their thoughts, being worried about internet backlash.</p>
              <p>That inspired me to do the same. Document as much of my time with dogs as possible, as well as my thouhts, insights and concerns. For me, to have a chance to observe things I miss in the moment and avoid stagnation. But also for others that are open to receive any information or motivation they can get.</p>
              <p>I throw it all on YouTube - no script, no editing, no agenda. Just raw footage of what's actually happening. The good sessions and the ones where nothing works.</p>
              <p>There should be no place in dog training for unsubstantied arguments about approaches, techniques and tools without showing how they are being used, and most importantly, what are the authentic results.</p>
              <p>And no client should accept any advice from someone, whether online or in-person, until they are able to explain the process behind it, how it's supposed to affect the dog's mental state, and can provide actual proof it worked for them in the past.</p>
              <p class="story-highlight">In the end, dogs are the only thing that matters. When you really pay attention — they never pretend, they never perform, they never lie.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-block">
              <h3>Here's what I'm actually offering</h3>
              <p>Conversation. Support. Advice if it helps. Joint training sessions if you're nearby.</p>
              <p>All free. But not to everyone.</p>
              <p>If you just want someone to tell you three steps to stop your dog from barking so you can get back to ignoring them, this isn't for you. There are plenty of trainers who'll take your money for that.</p>
              <p>But if you're curious about what's actually happening with your dog, if you want to understand rather than just apply a quick fix, we should talk.</p>
              <p>Why? Honestly, this is how I get better and while it's still a very distant future, at some point I want to retire from current software engineering career.</p>
              <p>However, it's not just that. I love talking dogs with people who actually care about their relationship with their animal. Sharing some knowledge, geeking out over training approaches and seeing someone suddenly <em>get</em> what their dog has been trying to tell them is genuinely rewarding and definitely a great way to spend time.</p>
              <p>For now, I'd rather be a part of a club than have business or a following.</p>
